The `README.md` file is titled "# slepping well" (note the typo in "sleeping").
It primarily consists of ten embedded images. Judging by the filenames (e.g., `sleep imp.PNG`, `stages of sleep.PNG`), these images are likely related to the importance and stages of sleep.
The README also contains a link to an external article on the Huffington Post website: [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/07/your-body-does-incredible_n_4914577.html](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/07/your-body-does-incredible_n_4914577.html), which discusses bodily functions during sleep.
